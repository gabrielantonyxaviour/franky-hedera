FrankyAgent is a decentralized framework for deploying and monetizing local AI agents running directly on user devices (e.g. phones). It enables on-device inference using lightweight LLMs, tracks agent performance through a private Hedera Consensus Service, and incentivizes high-uptime nodes using \$HBAR. Agent ownership is recorded using NFTs minted via the Hedera Token Service.

## 🧠 Key Features

* **♻️ Local LLM on Phones**
  Each device runs a lightweight agent using the **Hedera Agent Kit** for on-device inference and integration with Hedera services.

* **📡 Private Consensus Service for Validation**
  Devices publish their uptime, latency, and behavior metrics to a **self-hosted Consensus Service** on Hedera, enabling efficient and verifiable performance tracking.
  Hedera's **HCS-10 standard** is used exclusively for agent interaction and communication.

* **🧾 On-Chain Reputation**
  Each device signs its telemetry and pushes updates to its own topic within the private consensus layer.
  Any participant can subscribe, verify signatures, and compute performance scores.

* **💰 Incentives via \$HBAR**
  Rewards are distributed in **\$HBAR**, Hedera's native currency.
  Devices are ranked based on uptime and responsiveness, and periodic payouts are issued accordingly.

* **🪪 Agent Ownership via NFT**
  Each deployed agent is linked to an NFT minted through the **Hedera Token Service**, proving authorship and enabling agent transferability.

* **🌐 Agent Subdomains**
  Every deployed agent is assigned a human-readable subdomain like `kai.frankyagent.xyz`.
  Agent creators earn passive \$HBAR income when their agent is used or deployed on other devices.

## 🔁 Flow Overview

1. **Device Initialization:**
   A user sets up a FrankyAgent node on their phone. The node generates its keypair and topic ID.

2. **Telemetry Broadcasting:**
   The node signs and broadcasts telemetry to its own topic on the private Hedera Consensus Service.

3. **Peer Subscription & Validation:**
   Other nodes subscribe to topics, validate telemetry, and can flag abnormal behavior.

4. **Reputation Scoring:**
   A score is calculated based on uptime, latency, and peer verification.

5. **HBAR Incentives:**
   Periodic rewards in \$HBAR are distributed based on performance tiers.

6. **Agent Deployment:**
   Developers mint an NFT representing their agent. Others can deploy these agents and generate passive income for the creator.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

* All telemetry is signed by the device.
* Users control whether to expose logs publicly.
* Hedera Consensus Service provides timestamped, immutable logs without revealing sensitive data.

## 🌍 Use Cases

* Decentralized AI assistant grids.
* Local inference marketplace.
* Agent reputation leaderboards.
* Bot farms with on-chain telemetry.
* Incentivized compute networks.

## 📦 Technologies Used
