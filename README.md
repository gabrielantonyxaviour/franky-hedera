## Description

Not sure what to do with your OLD mobile? Franky helps you to run Local LLM Inference right in your device and **MONETIZE** your compute with **$HBAR** tokens. Device Owners could contribute their old devices to run LLMs locally and host AI agents on top of them to earn **$HBAR** tokens. Agent creators could choose a device of their choice to build their Agent from scratch with its very own custom characteristics and generate an API key to interact with them. Agents could also be made publicly available by the Agent Creator for others to use them and in-turn earn **$HBAR** tokens. Agent developers could build plugins in our AI Agent Framework to build custom functionalities. Each Agent has their VERY OWN custom subdomain which makes it readable and convenient to interact with.

## How it's made

The application is built on **Hedera Testnet** and uses native **$HBAR** tokens for API credits and consumption. We integrated **Wallet Connect** for onboarding and server wallets to manage operations in the backend.


An LLM runs locally in the mobile phone and the Agent Framework implemented for Franky Agents is a fork of the SillyTavern Framework.
